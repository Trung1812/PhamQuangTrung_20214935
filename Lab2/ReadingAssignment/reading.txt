If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No Java do not allow because 2 constructor method have the same name and the same input type as well as the same number of input, Java cannot differentiate these two methods when one of these methods get called in execution.
